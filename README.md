## Introduction

The orbital fitting algorithm processes observational data (`observations.csv`) to estimate the orbital parameters of Neptune's moon. It utilizes libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for computations and visualizations.

## Features

- Reads and processes observational data from CSV files.
- Fits orbital parameters using least squares optimization.
- Visualizes observed data and fitted orbits in 2D and 3D.
- Provides uncertainty estimates for fitted parameters.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/orbital-fitting-algorithm.git
   cd orbital-fitting-algorithm
